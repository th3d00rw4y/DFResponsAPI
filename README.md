<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This module was created to make user provisioning to the DFRespons system as easy as possible.
It was also created in a way that other organizations can utilize it.

### Built With

* [Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/)
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [DFRespons API documentation](https://docs.digitalfox.se/api/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
There are a few steps you need to complete before you can start using the CMDlets in this module.
Please make sure you've followed each one.

### Prerequisites

* Powershell 5.1
* Licensed version of DFRespons to get access to the API.
* API key and a service account provided by the vendor.

### Installation
1. Start a powershell session with the account that will be running the tasks. This is because when doing steps 4 & 5, the credential files will only be readable by the very same account that created them.
2. Download the DFResponsAPI module: `Install-Module -Name DFResponsAPI`
3. `Import-Module -Name DFResponsAPI`. You will get a warning saying that there is no settings file present, but let's skip this for now.
4. Run `New-Secret -Name <Name of the file> -Path <Path to store the secret> -Username <The API service account username>` You will be prompted to enter the password for the service account.
5. Again, run `New-Secret -Name <Name of the API key secret file> -Path <Path to store the secret>` You will once again be prompted to enter a password, which in this case would be the API key.
6. Run `Initialize-SettingsFile`. See /Docs/Initialize-SettingsFile.md for examples.
7. Finally import the module again `Import-Module DFResponsAPI -Force`. And you should be good to go!

  - [x] Changed name on:
      - [x] `Get-GestioSettings` -> `Get-GestioCategory`

              - [x] The wildcard parameter is kinda cool. It will allow you to search for one of the five strings with only a partial string.
      - [x] `Get-GestioNetworkList`

  - [x] New private functions:
      - [x] `Get-GestioSettings`
          - [x] This function will read the category and site categories from the API and store the sets in .txt files under $env:TEMP
      - [x] `Get-DynamicParameter`
          - [x] Builds parameters with validation sets based on the categories from the host and site files.
- 0.0.4 - 2021.04.04

          - [x] Parameters: `[string]`Ip, `[string]`Hostname, `[string]`Description, `[string]`Category, `[string]`, `[string]`Site, `[switch]`int_Admin, `[string]`Comment
      - [x] `Remove-GestioHost`
          - [x] Utilizing the request type "deleteHost", this function will based on either Ip or Hostname remove a host entry in Gesti칩IP.
          - [x] Parameters: `[string]`Ip, `[string]`Hostname
          - [x] Note from the API documentation: 
              - [i] IP addresses are unique. Hostnames may not be unique.
